        <p class="lead mb-4">From my perspective, culture is what brings a sense of community to a group of people by providing common values, beliefs and interests within this group. Within my family, we have a unique culture, one in which two cultures have merged to form the norms and values I learned growing up. My mother was born and raised in the US and my father was born in Mexico, bouncing back and forth from MX to the US throughout his childhood. Because of this I feel that I identify strongly with the Chicano culture/community. Culture in my family means honoring your familial history and background while being family oriented and treating each other with respect. When explaining who I am, where I come from and what I believe in I have always felt a sense of empowerment as I am proud of all of these things. Without my culture, I would not be the same woman I have grown to be; my entire identity revolves around it. 
I live my culture in various ways. Aside from the aforementioned aspects of my life, I also share my culture with those around me. In doing so I am helping keep my culture alive and teaching others the way I live my life. I think the biggest aspect of my life that has been altered by enculturation is the food I eat. The music I listen to is also something that manifests itself in my everyday life. My taste in music has been heavily influenced by my friends and family. I listen to all types of music all throughout my day and if it werenâ€™t for the influence of those around me, I would not have the taste I do.
All of my morals, values and virtues stem from the culture I have learned throughout my adolescence. Some norms that shape my behavior are respecting my parents' rules and decisions. Typically, teenagers decide to sneak behind their backs, however in my householdâ€™s culture, it's just standard to listen to and respect my parents wishes in order to better establish a trusting relationship. Another norm would be having to take responsibility for my siblings at times.  In both Mexican culture and my parentsâ€™ beliefs, it is encouraged for the eldest daughter to take in and care for their family regardless of any sacrifices necessary. 
Education is a strong value in my culture as it is deemed necessary to attend higher education and find a career that will help establish a stable lifestyle. Another value I hold is to be family oriented. A lot of my time is spent with my family or ensuring they are well taken care of. I am proud of my relationship with my family because I am always reminded of the strong support system I have beside me and I know I can always count on them. 
I believe one mental map of reality that shapes my behavior is the spectrum of what is affordable and what is not. It is very easy to get lost in consumer culture and cave into what is being advertised. However, anytime money can be saved I am
